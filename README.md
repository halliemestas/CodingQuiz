Coding Quiz

## Description and Requirements

Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score. To help prepare and become familiar with these tests, this moduleâ€™s Challenge built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

```
